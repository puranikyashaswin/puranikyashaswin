I'm an AI enthusiast and engineer exploring the rapidly evolving frontier of artificial intelligence. My goal is to move beyond traditional machine learning to build systems that are not just intelligent, but also practical, scalable, and capable of creating a positive impact. I believe the most powerful AI solutions are born from a deep understanding of their foundational principles and a relentless focus on production-ready engineering.

### üöÄ My Approach: From First Principles to Production

My work is a structured journey through the stack of modern AI. I start by deconstructing the core algorithms to understand *how* they work, then build robust applications, and finally, deploy them in high-performance, real-world environments. This first-principles approach ensures that the solutions I build are not just functional, but also efficient, reliable, and well-understood.
