I am a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building and deploying robust, scalable, and production-ready AI systems. My work focuses on the entire lifecycle of an ML project‚Äîfrom implementing core algorithms from scratch to serving them in high-performance, containerized environments.

### üöÄ About Me

I believe the best way to understand technology is to build it. My portfolio is a journey through the key pillars of modern AI engineering:

* üß† **Core Algorithms:** I started by implementing the Transformer architecture from the ground up to solidify my understanding of the models that power today's LLMs.
* üîß **Practical Applications:** I then applied this knowledge to build a real-world RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, focusing on the critical aspect of automated evaluation to ensure quality and reliability.
* üöÄ **Production & MLOps:** Finally, I engineered a high-performance serving engine with vLLM and created a full-stack application, demonstrating my ability to take a model from concept to a user-facing product.
